# De-idealize
> A travel planner app in React

**JourneyJoy** is developed using the latest version of React. It is an interactive travel journal that allows you to plan, record, and share your journeys. It provides the ability to add travel companions, organize activities by days, and upload travel documents, helping to keep all the details of your trips in one place.

## Some of the technologies and libraries I am using

**Material UI:** For the user interface.
**React Beautiful DnD:** For drag-and-drop functionality.
**Nivo:** For data visualization and charts.
**Firebase:** For managing user authentication and storing data in the cloud.
**API createContext:** To manage the application state.
